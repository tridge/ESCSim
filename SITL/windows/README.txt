AM32 SITL for Windows (64-bit)
=============================

1. Extract the entire ZIP with Explorer's "Extract All".
2. Double-click am32-sitl-gui.exe.
3. In "SITL process", choose DShot in the Input box and click "Start
   simulator". The firmware, bootloader, EEPROM and motor models are already
   included. Python, a compiler and a Cygwin installation are not required.
4. Enable the DShot pane, hold zero throttle for at least two seconds to
   arm, then adjust throttle. To use the DroneCAN pane instead, choose
   DroneCAN in the Input box before starting the simulator.

USB configurator support (one-time installation)
------------------------------------------------
USB support is optional for running the motor simulation.

1. Close work using USB devices; the driver installer restarts USB hubs.
2. Run USBIP\USBip-0.9.7.7-x64.exe and approve the administrator prompt.
   Install the USB/IP client and driver using the default options.
3. Reboot Windows after installation, even if the installer does not ask.
   The supplied driver is signed; do not enable Windows test-signing mode.
4. Launch am32-sitl-gui.exe normally and start the simulator.
5. Select "USB 4-way (fake FC)" above the ESC tabs. Its status will
   show a COM port when ready. The GUI attaches the device automatically.
6. Open https://am32.ca or https://am32.tridgell.net in Chrome or Edge.
   Connect to the displayed COM port and read the ESC settings.
7. Disconnect the configurator before choosing "No USB device", switching
   USB modes or closing the GUI. "USB serial (direct)" is for configurators
   that support a direct one-wire USB linker. In this mode am32.ca selects
   the direct protocol at 19200 baud automatically. Use Port select again
   after changing modes: direct mode has a different USB identity and
   reaches only the selected Direct ESC.
8. After editing ESC settings, select "No USB device", then Stop and Start
   the simulator to load the settings (equivalent to power-cycling an ESC).

No physical ESC, flight controller or USB cable is needed. GUI DShot transmission
is stopped when USB is enabled because both use the same simulated wire.
If no COM port appears, check the USB status for an error, reboot after driver
installation, and try again. Use the supplied USBip version. If installed to
a custom folder, set USBIP_EXE to the full path to usbip.exe before launching.

Choosing other firmware and bootloaders
--------------------------------------
Stop the simulator, use Browse next to "SITL binary" or "Bootloader", then
start it again. These must be Windows host SITL executables built from AM32
and AM32-bootloader. Build outputs may have an .elf extension despite being
Windows executables. Hardware ARM ELF/HEX images and Linux executables cannot
be run here. A bootloader must be selected for ESC configuration/flashing access.

Settings are saved in %LOCALAPPDATA%\AM32-SITL\eeprom.bin. The bootloader's
flash and backup files are stored alongside it. They survive GUI upgrades.
Use EEPROM Browse to choose a different writable image or to run separate
instances. To restore defaults, stop the GUI and rename the AM32-SITL folder.

This simulates firmware compiled for the host CPU. Uploading a hardware HEX
through a configurator exercises flash storage; it does not replace the host
program running the simulation. Select another host SITL binary with Browse
to run different firmware code.

USBIP\README.txt records the USB/IP installer origin and checksum.

Betaflight App motor control
---------------------------
1. Start the simulator with Input set to DShot.
2. Select "USB Betaflight (motor control)" and note the COM port.
3. Open https://app.betaflight.com in Chrome or Edge, select that port and
   connect. The Setup tab shows a stationary simulated accelerometer/gyro.
4. Open Motors. Motor numbers match the ESC tabs. Enable motor testing
   and raise individual sliders (or the master slider). Allow two seconds at zero
   throttle after startup for the ESC to arm.
5. DSHOT150/300/600, Bidirectional DShot and motor pole count can be changed
   in Motors, then saved with Save and Reboot. Enable Auto-Connect in the
   app, or reconnect after reboot. RPM and EDT telemetry come
   from each AM32 ESC. Flight dynamics are not simulated.
6. In CLI, use "set dshot_edt = ON" (or OFF/FORCE), "set dshot_bidir = ON",
   "set motor_pwm_protocol = DSHOT300", or "set motor_poles = 14", then
   "save". Only this small CLI subset is supported. Betaflight also sends
   EDT-enable when you turn on motor testing, independently of dshot_edt.
7. Disconnect Betaflight before switching USB modes. GUI DShot and CAN
   controls are disabled in this mode; the app owns motor control. Motor
   output returns to zero if MSP polling stops for two seconds.

FC settings are saved alongside ESC 1's selected EEPROM as <eeprom>.fc.json;
these are separate from AM32 settings in the ESC EEPROM. For the bundled
EEPROM both files live under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AM32-SITL. PID/filter fields
are compatibility placeholders, and do not simulate a flight controller's
control loop. GPS, barometer and magnetometer are absent. Flash AM32 using
its configurator and the USB 4-way mode; Betaflight FC flashing is unsupported.

Multiple ESCs
-------------
Choose 1 to 8 in the ESCs box; the default is one. Each ESC has its own tab
with controls, plots, motor model and EEPROM. Choosing or editing the SITL
binary or bootloader in any tab selects it for all ESCs, including tabs
added later. Changes apply when the simulators are next started. New tabs
inherit ESC 1's input options. DShot is the default input. Use Start all
and Stop all for the whole bench, or each tab's individual Start/Stop.
Stop all simulations and select No USB device before changing the count.

USB 4-way and USB Betaflight expose all configured ESCs through one COM
port. ESC numbers in the configurator match the tab numbers. USB serial
(direct) reaches only the selected Direct ESC; choose it while USB is off.
After writing settings in AM32 Configurator, Stop all and Start all to
reload them. Disconnect the browser before changing USB modes.

Each ESC needs its own EEPROM file. Extra default files are named
eeprom.esc2.bin through eeprom.esc8.bin under %LOCALAPPDATA%\AM32-SITL.
They remain when tabs are removed, so adding a tab again restores its
settings. FC protocol, bidirectional mode and pole count apply to all
motors; motor order is fixed in tab order. Each tab's DroneCAN controls use
a separate multicast bus. Signal/state ports increase by 10 per ESC.

DEMAGNETISATION BENCH / VIRTUAL OSCILLOSCOPE

In the simulation panel, choose a Benchmark (default: None), then click
"Start benchmark". Selecting a benchmark does not start it. Each run uses
the selected ESC, a private EEPROM and model snapshots in your Windows
temporary directory. "Stop benchmark" cancels the run and sends zero throttle.

Choose "Demag: full duty, 6S / 50 A" for the full-duty waveform and a
roughly 16 microsecond current-decay pulse. The run arms, ramps to full
throttle, then captures at 500 ns/sample and returns to zero throttle.
"Demag: full duty, light load" shows a shorter pulse; "Demag: partial-duty
PWM" shows the separate PWM-on/off voltage levels. "Demag: full duty, load
to desync" increases mechanical load after reaching full duty and captures
the first masked crossing. Its current rises above 50 A before the failure.

"Virtual scope (DHO804)" opens the four-channel scope. Use RUN / STOP,
SINGLE, time/div, per-channel scale/position and A/B cursors as on the
physical scope. Channels include phase voltage/current, back EMF,
virtual neutral and comparator output. "Fine capture" allows 500 ns
samples at 0.1x simulation speed, preserving PWM on/off voltage levels.
Save CSV + setup exports the physical data and firmware/model/settings
metadata; Save screen PNG exports the view. Both use a Windows save dialog.

The model is an estimated test case, not a calibrated copy of Alka's
motor or an emulation of the Rigol instrument's bandwidth/ADC. Select a
different native SITL executable with Browse to compare firmware fixes.
If a fix prevents the fault, Single may keep waiting: select a Commutation
or Edge trigger and RUN to inspect the healthy waveform instead.
