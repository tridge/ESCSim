Build a Renode platform (.repl) and script (.resc) from the active, cached
AM32 targets.h. A bounded in-process preprocessor resolves its nested target
and family conditionals without an installed embedded compiler; the tests
compare every supported result with GCC.

usage:
    gen_target.py TARGET [--outdir DIR]      write the pair, print both paths
    gen_target.py TARGET --run               generate, then launch renode
    gen_target.py TARGET --run --bootloader-elf ELF
                                             boot through a bootloader ELF
    gen_target.py TARGET --run --exec CMD    ... and script it
    gen_target.py TARGET --gui               ... driven by ESCSim's GUI
    gen_target.py TARGET --gui --cpusel N    ... pinned to host CPU N
    gen_target.py TARGET --sigrok            ... live logic analyser on TCP
    gen_target.py --list                     targets this can emulate

F051, F031, G071, G031, L431, G431, V203, E230, A153, F415 and F421
targets work, _CAN variants included - the L431's and F415's bxCAN and
the G431's FDCAN are all modelled. Anything else exits 77, as the test
harness does for a skip.
