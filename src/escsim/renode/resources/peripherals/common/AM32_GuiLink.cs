//
// Serves the SITL's two UDP wire protocols from inside the emulator, so
// Mcu/SITL/sitl_gui.py drives an emulated ESC with no idea which backend
// is on the other end:
//   input port  (Mcu/SITL/Src/sitl_input.c) - throttle in, BDShot replies out
//   state port  (Mcu/SITL/Src/sitl_state.c) - physics samples, eeprom, model
//
// Setpoints, not a wire recording. This is the one deliberate deviation
// from what the SITL does, and it is forced by the clock: Renode runs at
// about 0.11x real time, so a GUI streaming servo frames at 50Hz of wall
// clock is a 5.5Hz signal as the firmware experiences it, well under the
// rate detectInput() needs, and nothing ever arms. An incoming packet
// therefore sets the generator's throttle rather than becoming one frame
// on the wire, and AM32ThrottleGenerator synthesises correctly timed
// frames in virtual time. The frames the firmware decodes are still real
// pin edges through the real capture and DMA path - what is lost is the
// ability to drive malformed or oddly rated signals from the GUI, which
// stays a SITL job.
//
// Frame rate is a property here rather than something the GUI sets, for
// the same reason: the sender's rate is wall clock and means nothing in
// virtual time.
//
// Everything that touches emulated state happens on the emulation
// thread, in Tick. The socket threads only latch: one slot for the
// newest setpoint (so a paused emulation cannot build a backlog - the
// newest setpoint is the only one that matters) and a bounded queue for
// state commands.
